Hi folks,

Opencores encourages the use of free tools for synthesis, but so far have not seen a proposal for verification IPs in the present moment and not dedicated myself to look on the site if there were people who would be doing what I'm doing. I am providing a system designed to verify the functionality of AES128 environment. Still not finished and still need to document about the process of verification of the same. Until then has only checking the ECB still lacks the test piece with CBC and CTR. 

I chose the icarus verilog because it already had a previous experience with it and it provides a PLI interface that enables the use of C/C++.

I will post bugs to be solved by Design. Be patient more updates will come.


IF you want to test another cases on env go to aes_bfm_generate.h and change type_bfm = ECB_KEY_GEN_CCFIE to another constatnt where can be see on env_aes.c

Added cases of CBC / CTR tests. Update BUGS.

Finalized basics tests cases with checking on monitor 

MODS ECB ARE OK
MODS CBC ARE OK
MODS CTR ARE OK --> The Forbidden case has a different output zero for KEY GENERATION


The basic environment is mounted and the core with the modes are tested, only missing the datatype mode to be checked.

Finished all cases tests using DATATYPE. I dont find any errors till now using data type, and we make so updates on host_interface.v because SR was doing updates without computation is complete. There are a case where called sufle where have all possible cases situable on init.h but i thinking about to do yet.

MODS ECB/CBC/CTR with DATATYPE configurations is done.

I see the trunk when you try to compile the env it give a error, so if you want compile i recommend you put a folder from icarus verilog on same folder where env is it. i tried fix it to make more simple.
